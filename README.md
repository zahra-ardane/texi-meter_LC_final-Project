# texi-meter_LC_final-Project

This project is a module which calculates the cost that each passenger who uses our taxi has to pay.
There can be 2 types od passengers : normal and exclusive
The weather can be "nomral" or "rainy".
The basic price is 10 rials.
The taxi can be "moving" or "stoping".
The price that each person has to pay will be calculated based on the passenger type, weather state and taxi's state as long as they're inside.
While the taxi is "stoping" for each clock pulse 5 rials will be added to every passanger's account.
While the taxi is "moving", exclusive passengers pay 16 rials and normal passengers pay 8 rials each pulse.
